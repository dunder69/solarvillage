    <h1>Rio Grande del Norte National Monument</h1>
<p>
Here is where you’ll find the rare river access down into the gorge; in the ‘Wild Rivers‘ area. Enjoy the dramatic open scenery, well-marked trails, and facilities along the paved loop road.   (Turn left/west onto hwy 378 2.6m north of Questa’s traffic light.)
</p>

<p>
The Big Arsenic Springs trail leads down to where the spring flows into the Rio Grande; a perfect picnic spot, with petroglyphs just another 1/4m upriver.  La Junta Trail is a very steep route to the joining of the Red River and Rio Grande, but a stunning hike.  Less rigorous trails meander through the open landscape above the river gorge, including the Vistas de Questa trail that runs from the north side of our village into the quiet heart of the monument.
</p>

<h2>Camping</h2>
<p>
The BLM (Bureau of Land Management) hosts the campsites at the Wild Rivers area of our new monument.  This beautiful area with its river trails is accessed 2.6m north of Questa; turn west onto highway 378 and wind through the settlement of Cerro then into the open, splendid scenery of the monument.
</p>

<p>
Camping consists of sites on the rim of the river gorge suitable for tents or RV’s (four sites with hook-ups for $15/night).  Handicap-accessible overlooks, fresh water, shelters, grills, and bathrooms are available.
</p>

<p>
There are also idyllic campsites on the bottom of the gorge at river’s edge.  These are a mile-long hike down, and also have shelters with grills, and bathrooms nearby.
</p>

<h1>The Carson National Forest</h1>
<h2>Meadows, streams, wild flowers and cool forests define these trails between Questa and Red River on Highway 38.</h2>

<p>
Columbine Canyon is a favorite for short or long excursions.  Cabresto Lake, just NE of Questa (look for the sign pointing left ½m down hwy 38) is a beautiful mountain lake with ideal fishing, canoeing, and hiking.  Heart Lake is a farther 5m hike off the north end of Cabresto Lake, with an added mile to the ridge that looks out over the whole Questa area.  This route is the southern approach to the broad vistas of the Latir Lakes area of Rio Costilla Park. (access INTO the park is from the north.)
</p>

<h2>Camping</h2>
<p>
The Forest Service’s Questa Ranger District oversees campsites between Questa and Red River.  Their area also includes Cabresto Lake just NE of town (with fishing, canoeing, and hiking), and also Cebolla Mesa just south of Questa, with trails leading into the ‘Wild Rivers’ area of the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument (though there is no bridge across the river here).  They also oversee the beautiful Valle Vidal sites an hour and a half northeast of town; turn east off of hwy. 522 at the crossroads in Costilla, onto hwy 196.
</p>
<p>
Most Forest Service sites are first come-first serve, but Cimarron Campground in the Valle Vidal and Fawn Lakes between Questa and Red River can be reserved online (at least 10 days ahead) through Reserve America.

<h1>Rio Costilla Park</h1>
<p>
The park is high in the mountaintops that overlook our area.  The park is on private land and requires permission to enter.  This can be obtained at the park office just 1m off highway 522 after turning onto highway 196 at the crossroads in Costilla.
</p>

<p>
This is about a half-hour north of Questa, with the park entrance another half-hour’s drive.
</p>

<h2>Camping</h2>
<p>
This is private land under State Forestry auspices.  It’s located forty-five minutes north of Questa and opens for the summer.  Depending on the snow pack, access to Latir Lakes may not open until mid-June or July.  Turn east off of hwy 522 onto State Rd. 196 at Costilla and continue 1 mile to their main office at #72.  The park entrance is 15 miles further (rd. will turn to gravel).
</p>

<p>
This park is striking for its purity and grandeur, with stunning mountain views, remote lakes, abundant elk, deer, and also bear and wild cats.  4-wheel-drive is recommended for some sites.  RV’s welcome, though no hook-ups are available.
